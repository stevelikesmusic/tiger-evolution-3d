# Tiger Movement & Camera Progress Report

## Current Session Summary
Date: [Current Session]
Goal: Fix tiger movement controls and camera following behavior

## Issues Addressed This Session

### ‚úÖ **COMPLETED FIXES**

1. **Tiger Visual Clarity** - FIXED
   - Added head with eyes, ears, nose at front (-Z direction)
   - Added tail at back (+Z direction)
   - Eyes made larger (0.15 radius) and positioned at (-0.25, 0.3, -1.9) and (0.25, 0.3, -1.9)
   - Tiger now clearly shows front vs back

2. **Movement System Architecture** - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Separated rotation logic from movement logic
   - Tiger can now move in all directions (WASD)
   - Movement directions corrected (W = forward, S = backward)
   - Rotation directions corrected (A = rotate left, D = rotate right)

3. **Camera Following** - PARTIALLY FIXED
   - Camera smoothness increased from 0.1 to 0.3
   - Camera positioning logic updated to follow behind tiger
   - Camera should track tiger rotation and position

### ‚ùå **REMAINING ISSUES**

1. **Diagonal Movement Not Intuitive**
   - Current: W+A makes tiger rotate while moving forward
   - Expected: W+A should move diagonally forward-left in world space
   - Tiger should face movement direction but movement should be relative to initial orientation

2. **Camera Following Issues**
   - Camera may not consistently stay behind tiger
   - Camera tests still failing in some scenarios

## Current Code State

### Movement System (`src/systems/Movement.js`)
- **Lines 78-98**: `updateRotation()` - Rotates tiger to face movement direction
- **Lines 100-129**: `applyMovementForces()` - Applies diagonal movement in world coordinates
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Rotation speed: 3 rad/s
  - Movement uses normalized diagonal vectors
  - World-space movement (not tiger-local)

### Camera System (`src/systems/Camera.js`)
- **Lines 16**: Smoothness = 0.3
- **Lines 68-82**: Camera positioning behind tiger using rotation offset
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Distance: 15 units
  - Height: 8 units
  - Follows tiger rotation

### Tiger Model (`src/entities/TigerModel.js`)
- **Lines 13-86**: Complete 3D model with head, eyes, ears, tail
- Head at front (-1.5 Z), tail at back (+1.8 Z)
- Eyes clearly visible for orientation

## Tests Created
- `RotationOnlyMovement.test.js` - Tests pure rotation vs movement
- `GradualTurning.test.js` - Tests smooth rotation behavior
- `CameraFollowing.test.js` - Tests camera behind positioning (some tests failing)
- `BasicMovementTest.test.js` - Debug test for current behavior

## Next Session TODO

### üéØ **Priority 1: Fix Diagonal Movement**
The core issue is user expectation vs current behavior:

**User Expectation**: W+A = move diagonally forward-left relative to starting position
**Current Behavior**: W+A = rotate left while moving forward

**Potential Solutions**:
1. **Option A**: Make WASD pure directional movement (no rotation), add separate rotation keys (Q/E)
2. **Option B**: Make diagonal movement work in camera-relative coordinates
3. **Option C**: Implement "tank controls" where left/right only rotate, forward/back only move in facing direction

### üéØ **Priority 2: Fix Camera Consistency**
- Ensure camera always follows behind tiger
- Fix camera test failures
- Make camera more responsive to tiger rotation changes

### üéØ **Priority 3: Movement Feel**
- Ensure movement feels natural and predictable
- Tiger should face movement direction
- No unwanted sliding or drifting

## Key Files Modified This Session
- `/src/systems/Movement.js` - Complete rewrite of movement logic
- `/src/systems/Camera.js` - Camera smoothness and positioning fixes
- `/src/entities/TigerModel.js` - Added visual features (head, eyes, tail)
- `/tests/unit/RotationOnlyMovement.test.js` - Movement behavior tests
- `/tests/unit/GradualTurning.test.js` - Rotation behavior tests

## Commands to Resume Testing
```bash
npm run dev                    # Test in browser
npm test -- RotationOnlyMovement.test.js  # Test movement behavior
npm test -- CameraFollowing.test.js       # Test camera behavior (some failing)
```

## User Feedback Summary
- "When I press W+A, I expect diagonal movement, not forward movement with rotation"
- "Camera should stay behind tiger during movement"
- "Tiger visual clarity much better with eyes and tail"
- Movement directions now correct (W=forward, A=left rotation)

## Technical Notes
- Tiger rotation uses Y-axis (Three.js standard)
- World coordinates: -Z is forward, +X is right
- Camera uses spherical coordinates around tiger
- Movement system separates rotation input from movement input
- All tests for basic movement pass, but user experience still not ideal
