    Math.pow(tigerY - bubble.position.y, 2) +
    Math.pow(tigerZ - bubble.position.z, 2)
  );
  const popDistance = bubble.userData.size + 3.0; // Large collision radius
  if (distance <= popDistance) this.popBubble(i);
}

// Safe teleportation with velocity reset
teleportToUnderwaterTerrain() {
  this.movementSystem.setVelocity(0, 0, 0); // Clear momentum

   - **Enhanced Tiger Model**: More detailed cube-based tiger with better proportions
   - **Improved Animal Models**: Better deer, boar, rabbit models with distinctive features
   - **Visual Polish**: Better texturing, colors, and model details

2. **Animation System**:
   - **Walking Animations**: Basic leg movement for animals
   - **Attack Animations**: Tiger pouncing and attacking motions
   - **State Animations**: Different poses for idle, alert, fleeing states

3. **Visual Effects**:
   - **Combat Effects**: Blood particles, impact effects
   - **Movement Trails**: Dust clouds when running
   - **Environmental Integration**: Better model scaling and positioning

#### üåä **Phase 10: Underwater Wildlife (FOLLOWING SESSION)**
1. **Fish Schools**: Dynamic schooling behavior, predator avoidance
2. **Aquatic Prey**: Tiger fishing mechanics, underwater hunting
3. **Water-Based Predators**: Crocodiles, underwater threats

#### üåç **Phase 11: Environmental Enhancement (FUTURE)**
1. **Weather System**: Rain, fog, dynamic weather affecting visibility
2. **Day/Night Cycle**: Dynamic lighting, different animal behaviors by time
3. **Audio Integration**: Ambient jungle sounds, animal calls, footsteps
4. **Enhanced Terrain**: Biome variation (dense forest, riverbanks, rocky outcrops)
5. **Particle Effects**: Water splashes, dust clouds, environmental atmosphere

#### üéÆ **Phase 12: Advanced Systems (LONG-TERM)**
1. **Tiger Evolution**: Growth stages (cub ‚Üí adult ‚Üí alpha), stat progression
2. **Territory System**: Marking, defending, expanding territory
3. **Survival Elements**: Enhanced hunger, thirst, stamina management, oxygen levels underwater
4. **Enhanced Lighting**: Filtered sunlight through canopy, dynamic shadows, underwater caustics
5. **Multiplayer**: Other players as tigers in shared jungle environment

#### üîß **Technical Debt & Polish (ONGOING)**
1. **Test Suite Updates**: Add GameSave tests, MainMenu tests, fix camera/movement tests for dual-mode
2. **Performance Optimization**: LOD system, chunk loading for larger worlds, underwater rendering optimization
3. **UI System**: Enhanced health/stamina bars, minimap, interaction prompts, underwater HUD
4. **Save/Load System**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - Game state persistence with auto-save functionality

## Workflow

Follow this flow when performing your tasks

1. Read the [spec](.claude/spec.md)
2. Read the progress.md and project.md in .claude
3. Checkout a new branch for the feature
4. Make regular commits
5. Use TDD to write tests first based on your goals
6. Update documentation with new context and/or tools you added
