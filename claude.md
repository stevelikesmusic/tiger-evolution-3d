### üîß **RECENT IMPLEMENTATION (Current Session)**

#### üåä **Phase 2: Complete Water System Implementation**
**Goal**: Transform blue terrain patches into realistic swimming environment

**Major Changes**:
1. **Water System Rewrite (`WaterSystem.js`)**:
   - Replaced terrain-based water detection with proper 3D water bodies
   - Large central lake (35-unit radius) + winding river + scattered ponds
   - Animated shader with realistic wave effects and transparency
   - Connected water bodies instead of fragmented patches

2. **Swimming Mechanics (`MovementSystem.js`)**:
   - Automatic swimming detection when tiger enters water
   - Modified physics: buoyancy (15 units), water resistance (0.8x), reduced gravity
   - Swimming-specific controls: 0.7x speed, jump for upward movement
   - Proper collision with water surface and terrain boundaries

3. **Integration (`GameController.js`)**:
   - Connected water system to movement system
   - Added water system regeneration when terrain changes
   - Proper cleanup and resource management

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Water detection
isInWater(x, z) {
  for (const waterBody of this.waterBodies) {
    if (waterBody.type === 'lake' || waterBody.type === 'pond') {
      const distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x - waterBody.center.x, 2) + Math.pow(z - waterBody.center.z, 2));
      if (distance <= waterBody.radius) return true;
    }
  }
}

// Swimming physics
applyGravity(deltaTime) {
  if (this.isSwimming) {
    const buoyancy = 15;
    const waterResistance = 0.8;
    this.velocity.y += (buoyancy + this.gravity * 0.3) * deltaTime;
    this.velocity.y *= waterResistance;
  }
}
```

**Result**: Realistic aquatic environment with proper swimming mechanics! ‚úÖ
