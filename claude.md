### üîß **RECENT IMPLEMENTATION (Current Session)**

#### üåä **Phase 3: Professional Water System & Aquatic Ecosystem**
**Goal**: Create professional-grade water with lily pad navigation and ecosystem integration

**Major Changes**:
1. **Professional Water Enhancement (`WaterSystem.js`)**:
   - All water now uses Three.js Water class with realistic reflections/refractions
   - Performance optimized: 128x128 render targets, distance culling
   - Floating lily pads with flowers as jump platforms (~30% coverage)
   - Mushroom generation replacing small water bodies (realistic design)
   - Depth-based transparency and wave animations

2. **Enhanced Movement Controls (`MovementSystem.js` + `Input.js`)**:
   - Fixed inverted WASD controls (W=forward, S=backward, A=left, D=right)
   - Surface-aware friction: lily pads (0.7x) vs land (0.85x) for precise control
   - Enhanced acceleration (1.5x) on lily pads for responsive navigation
   - Depth-aware swimming: shallow water allows jumping, deep water requires swimming

3. **Ecosystem Integration (`VegetationSystem.js` + `GameController.js`)**:
   - Water-aware vegetation placement with 3-unit shore buffers
   - Trees/bushes cannot spawn in water areas
   - Clean, natural shorelines around all water bodies
   - Generation order: water first, then vegetation avoids water areas

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Professional Water class creation
const water = new Water(geometry, {
  textureWidth: 128,         // Optimized render targets
  textureHeight: 128,
  waterNormals: this.waterNormalsTexture,
  sunDirection: new THREE.Vector3(0.70710678, 0.70710678, 0),
  waterColor: 0x001e0f,
  distortionScale: 1.2       // Realistic wave distortion
});

// Lily pad collision and physics
isOnLilyPad(x, z) {
  for (const lilyPadGroup of this.lilyPads) {
    const distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(x - lilyPadGroup.position.x, 2) + 
                              Math.pow(z - lilyPadGroup.position.z, 2));
    if (distance <= 1.5) return true;
  }
}

// Surface-aware friction system
getCurrentFriction() {
  if (this.waterSystem.isOnLilyPad(this.tiger.position.x, this.tiger.position.z)) {
    return 0.7;  // Enhanced stopping power on lily pads
  }
  return 0.85;   // Normal ground friction
}
```

**Result**: Professional aquatic ecosystem with lily pad navigation and precise controls! ‚úÖ
