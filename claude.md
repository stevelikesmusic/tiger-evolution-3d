### üîß **RECENT IMPLEMENTATION (Latest Session - Underwater Performance & UX Improvements)**

#### üåä **Phase 5: Underwater Performance & User Experience Enhancements**
**Goal**: Fix underwater system performance issues and improve user experience with natural vegetation distribution

**Major Fixes & Improvements**:
1. **Bubble System Performance (`UnderwaterSystem.js`)**:
   - **Reduced Bubble Size**: From 1-3 units to 0.3-0.7 units (no more lag)
   - **Tiger Needle Concept**: Precise collision detection where tiger acts as needle popping balloon bubbles
   - **Optimized Geometry**: Reduced poly count from 16x12 to 8x6 for performance
   - **Fewer Bubbles**: Reduced count from radius√ó1.2 to radius√ó0.5 per water body
   - **Proper Floating**: Bubbles rise at 2.0 units/sec with gentle side-to-side drift

2. **Massive Vegetation Enhancement (`UnderwaterSystem.js`)**:
   - **Towering Seaweed**: Increased from 12-20 units to 30-50 units tall with thick stems (0.2-0.7 radius)
   - **Massive Seagrass**: Increased from 4-10 units to 15-40 units tall with 30-50 thick blades per patch
   - **Natural Distribution**: Vegetation now spreads in radius√ó2 area around water bodies instead of dense clumps
   - **Scattered Placement**: Additional plants placed randomly across radius√ó4 area for natural look
   - **Reduced Density**: Only 40% chance to place vegetation for scattered, realistic distribution

3. **Safe Teleportation System (`GameController.js`)**:
   - **Velocity Reset**: Clear all momentum before teleporting to prevent terrain conflicts
   - **Safe Positioning**: Higher placement (3.0 units above underwater floor, 2.5 above surface)
   - **Proper Sequencing**: Position first, then change movement mode to avoid crashes
   - **No More Terrain Collisions**: Fixed terrain crash issues when switching between modes

4. **Collision Detection Improvements (`UnderwaterSystem.js`)**:
   - **Precise Distance Calculation**: Using proper 3D distance formula for tiger needle vs bubble balloon
   - **Optimized Performance**: Only check collisions when underwater system is active
   - **Better Feedback**: Clean console logging for debugging bubble interactions

**Technical Implementation**:
```javascript
// Underwater terrain generation with deep positioning
createUnderwaterFloor(waterBody) {
  const underwaterDepth = 8 + (waterBody.radius * 0.1); // 8+ units deep
  const floorY = terrainHeight - underwaterDepth;
  const floorMaterial = new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({ color: 0x8B4513 }); // Brown
}

// Interactive bubble system with collision detection
checkBubbleCollisions(tigerX, tigerY, tigerZ) {
  for (let i = this.bubbleMeshes.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    const bubble = this.bubbleMeshes[i];
    const distance = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(tigerX - bubble.position.x, 2) + 
                              Math.pow(tigerY - bubble.position.y, 2) + 
                              Math.pow(tigerZ - bubble.position.z, 2));
    if (distance <= tigerRadius + bubble.userData.size) {
      this.popBubble(i); // Pop and respawn
    }
  }
}

// Dual-mode movement system
applyUnderwaterMovement(deltaTime) {
  const leftRight = this.inputDirection.x;   // A/D = strafe
  const upDown = this.inputDirection.y;      // W/S = up/down
  const forwardBack = this.inputDirection.z; // G/B = forward/backward
  const speedMultiplier = this.isInsideLog ? 1.3 : 1.0; // Enhanced log speed
}

// Teleportation with terrain switching
teleportToUnderwaterTerrain() {
  this.isUnderwater = true;
  this.underwaterSystem.activate();
  waterMeshes.forEach(mesh => mesh.visible = false); // Hide surface water
  terrainMesh.material.color.setHex(0x8B4513); // Brown underwater ground
}

// Realistic tiger leg anatomy
addLegs() {
  const legs = ['frontLeft', 'frontRight', 'backLeft', 'backRight'];
  legs.forEach(position => {
    const upperLeg = new THREE.Mesh(upperLegGeometry, legMaterial);
    const lowerLeg = new THREE.Mesh(lowerLegGeometry, legMaterial); 
    const paw = new THREE.Mesh(pawGeometry, pawMaterial);
    this.addLegStripes(legGroup, upperLength, lowerLength, thickness);
  });
}
```

**Result**: High-performance underwater ecosystem with massive vegetation, optimized bubbles, and crash-free teleportation! ‚úÖ
