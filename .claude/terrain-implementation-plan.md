## Phase 2: Water Systems 🌊

### Rivers and Streams
**Priority: HIGH**
```javascript
// Planned Implementation
class WaterSystem {
  generateRiverNetwork(terrain, seed) {
    // 1. Find natural water flow paths using terrain gradients
    // 2. Create meandering rivers following elevation
    // 3. Generate tributaries and stream networks
    // 4. Add water level management
  }
}
```

**Features to Implement:**
- **Flow Simulation**: Water follows terrain gradients naturally
- **Visual Effects**: Animated water surface with reflections
- **Physics**: Water collision detection, swimming mechanics
- **Ecosystem**: Rivers affect vegetation growth patterns
- **Sound**: Flowing water ambient audio

### Lakes and Ponds
**Priority: MEDIUM**

- **Water Level**: Dynamic water table affecting surrounding areas
- **Reflection System**: Mirror reflections of sky and vegetation
- **Aquatic Life**: Fish, frogs, insects around water bodies

## Phase 3: Advanced Terrain Features 🏔️

### Terrain Biomes
**Priority: HIGH**
```javascript
// Biome System Architecture
class BiomeSystem {
  getBiomeAt(x, z) {
    // Based on: elevation, moisture, temperature, slope
    // Returns: JUNGLE_FLOOR, JUNGLE_CANOPY, RIVERBANK, ROCKY_OUTCROP
  }
}
```

**Biome Types:**
1. **Dense Jungle Floor** - Thick undergrowth, limited visibility
2. **Jungle Canopy** - Elevated areas with tall trees
3. **Riverbank** - Lush vegetation near water
4. **Rocky Outcrops** - Steep, sparse vegetation areas
5. **Clearings** - Open spaces with different gameplay

### Caves and Underground
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Cave Generation**: Natural cave systems in rocky areas
- **Underground Water**: Springs and underground streams
- **Den Locations**: Tiger resting and breeding areas
- **Resource Nodes**: Special hunting or foraging spots

### Terrain Layers
**Priority: LOW**
```javascript
// Multi-layer Terrain System
class LayeredTerrain {
  layers = {
    bedrock: HeightmapLayer,     // Base elevation
    soil: HeightmapLayer,        // Erosion and deposition
    vegetation: VegetationLayer, // Plant growth simulation
    snow: SeasonalLayer          // Weather effects
  }
}
```

## Phase 4: Dynamic Terrain 🌱

### Seasonal Changes
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Wet/Dry Seasons**: Terrain moisture affects vegetation
- **River Levels**: Seasonal flooding and drought
- **Vegetation Cycles**: Plant growth and decay
- **Animal Migration**: Seasonal prey movement patterns

### Erosion and Growth
**Priority: LOW**
- **Real-time Erosion**: Gradual terrain changes over time
- **Vegetation Growth**: Trees and plants grow dynamically
- **Landslides**: Steep terrain occasionally shifts
- **Path Formation**: Frequently traveled routes become trails

---

## Phase 5: Terrain Interaction Systems 🎮

### Scent and Tracking
**Priority: HIGH**
```javascript
// Scent Map System
class ScentSystem {
  scentMap = new Map(); // Position -> [scent_type, strength, age]
  
  addScent(position, type, strength) {
    // Scent spreads based on wind and terrain
    // Affected by water (rivers wash away scent)
    // Different strengths on different terrain types
  }
}
```

**Features:**
- **Prey Trails**: Animals leave scent trails to follow
- **Territory Marking**: Tiger can mark territory
- **Wind Effects**: Scent carried by wind direction
- **Terrain Absorption**: Different surfaces hold scent differently

### Stealth and Cover
**Priority: MEDIUM**
- **Line of Sight**: Dense vegetation blocks vision
- **Sound Propagation**: Different terrain affects noise travel
- **Cover System**: Tall grass and bushes provide hiding spots
- **Elevation Advantage**: High ground improves detection range

### Destructible Environment
**Priority: LOW**
- **Vegetation Damage**: Tiger can push through bushes
- **Terrain Wear**: Paths form from repeated use
- **Scratch Marks**: Tiger can mark trees and rocks
- **Digging**: Create temporary dens or hide food

## Technical Architecture 🏗️

### Performance Optimization
```javascript
// Level-of-Detail System
class TerrainLOD {
  chunks = new Map(); // Divide terrain into manageable chunks
  
  updateChunk(chunkId, distanceFromPlayer) {
    if (distance > FAR_DISTANCE) {
      // Use low-poly mesh, simplified vegetation
    } else if (distance > MEDIUM_DISTANCE) {
      // Medium detail
    } else {
      // Full detail with all systems active
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Structures
- **Spatial Indexing**: Quad-tree for efficient terrain queries
- **Chunk Loading**: Stream terrain data as tiger moves
- **Memory Management**: Unload distant terrain chunks
- **Threading**: Generate terrain chunks on worker threads

### Procedural Generation Pipeline
1. **Base Heightmap**: Perlin noise with multiple octaves
2. **Biome Assignment**: Based on elevation and moisture
3. **Erosion Simulation**: Hydraulic and thermal erosion
4. **Water Table**: Determine water body locations
5. **Vegetation Placement**: Biome-appropriate flora
6. **Detail Features**: Rocks, fallen logs, special locations

## Integration with Game Systems 🎯

### Tiger Behavior Adaptations
- **Terrain Preferences**: Tigers avoid deep water, prefer dense cover
- **Movement Speed**: Different terrain types affect movement
- **Hunting Strategies**: Use terrain for ambush tactics
- **Territory Selection**: Claim areas with good hunting and water access

### AI and Pathfinding
```javascript
// Terrain-Aware Pathfinding
class TerrainPathfinding {
  getCost(fromPos, toPos) {
    const slope = terrain.getSlope(toPos.x, toPos.z);
    const vegetation = terrain.getVegetationDensity(toPos.x, toPos.z);
    const water = terrain.getWaterDepth(toPos.x, toPos.z);
    
    return baseCost + slopePenalty + vegetationBonus + waterPenalty;
  }
}
```

### Resource Management
- **Water Sources**: Tiger must drink regularly
- **Shelter Locations**: Caves and dense vegetation for rest
- **Hunting Grounds**: Open areas with good prey visibility
- **Safe Zones**: High ground for threat detection
