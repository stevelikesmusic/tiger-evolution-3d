# Tiger Evolution 3D - WebGL Game Specification

## Core Game Concept
Create a realistic 3D tiger evolution and survival game set in an immersive jungle environment. The player controls a tiger through third-person perspective that must hunt, survive, and evolve while navigating a dynamic ecosystem with various animals and environmental challenges.

## Technical Requirements

### **Platform & Framework**
- **Engine**: Three.js (latest version r177+)
- **Graphics**: WebGL 2.0 with fallback to WebGL 1.0
- **Physics**: Cannon.js or Rapier.js for realistic collisions and movement
- **Performance Target**: 60 FPS on modern browsers, 30 FPS minimum on mobile
- **Compatibility**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (desktop & mobile)

### **3D Rendering Architecture**
- **Camera System**: Third-person follow camera with smooth lerping
- **Scene Management**: Octree spatial partitioning for efficient rendering
- **LOD System**: Level-of-detail models for distant objects
- **Instanced Rendering**: For vegetation, rocks, and environmental objects
- **Shadow Mapping**: Real-time shadows with cascade shadow maps
- **Post-Processing**: Bloom, tone mapping, and color grading

### **Optimization Strategies**
- **Frustum Culling**: Only render objects within camera view
- **Object Pooling**: Reuse game objects to reduce garbage collection
- **Texture Atlasing**: Combine smaller textures into larger atlases
