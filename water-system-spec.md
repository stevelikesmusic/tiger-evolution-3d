# Three.js Tiger Survival Game - Advanced Water System Implementation

## Required Water System Features

### 1. Water Body Design & Layout
- **Pre-designed localized water bodies**: Interconnected streams, rivers, and ponds
- **Dynamic water levels**: Seasonal/tidal changes that affect gameplay
- **Realistic depth mapping**: Shallow edges transitioning to deeper centers
- **Flow direction mapping**: Streams/rivers with defined current directions and speeds

### 2. Visual & Shader Requirements
- **Realistic water shaders**: Reflections, refractions, caustics, foam
- **Depth-based transparency**: Clearer in shallow areas, darker in deep water
- **Surface animation**: Wave motion, ripples, flowing water textures
- **Environmental interaction**: Water reacts to weather, lighting, time of day

### 3. Physics & Buoyancy System
- **Cannon.js integration**: Seamless physics interaction with existing system
- **Dynamic buoyancy**: Objects float realistically based on density/volume
- **Water resistance**: Movement speed changes based on water depth/flow
- **Current simulation**: Flowing water affects object movement (downstream faster, upstream slower)

### 4. Tiger Character Interactions
- **Entry/exit effects**: Splashing, ripples, waves when tiger enters/exits water
- **Swimming mechanics**: 
  - Reduced movement speed in water
  - Swimming animations trigger
  - Stamina system for swimming
  - Current affects movement (faster downstream, slower upstream)
- **Depth-based behavior**: Wading in shallow water vs swimming in deep water

### 5. Gameplay Integration
- **Hunting mechanics**: Tiger can hunt fish and aquatic prey
- **River crossing**: Strategic gameplay element for navigation
- **Water as obstacle/resource**: Affects AI pathfinding and player strategy
- **Environmental storytelling**: Water attracts prey animals

### 6. Performance Optimization
- **LOD system**: Water detail reduces with distance
- **Efficient particle systems**: Optimized splash/ripple effects
- **Shader optimization**: Maintain 60fps on target platforms
- **Culling**: Water effects only render when visible

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### Research Phase
1. **Evaluate water libraries**: Research Three.js water libraries (Ocean.js, three-water, etc.)
2. **Shader techniques**: Study realistic water rendering approaches
3. **Physics integration**: Best practices for Cannon.js + water simulation
4. **Performance patterns**: Optimization strategies for complex water systems

### Design Phase
1. **System architecture**: Modular water system design
2. **Data structures**: Water body definitions, flow maps, depth maps
3. **Integration plan**: How to integrate with existing terrain/physics
4. **Performance budget**: Frame rate targets and optimization checkpoints

### Implementation Phase
1. **Core water renderer**: Shaders, materials, geometry generation
2. **Physics integration**: Buoyancy, currents, collision detection
3. **Interaction system**: Tiger swimming, object floating, splash effects
4. **Gameplay hooks**: Hunting, navigation, environmental effects
5. **Performance optimization**: LOD, culling, efficient rendering
